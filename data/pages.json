The created blogs become fully potable without any dependencies such as database or any other complicated setups. All data of the blog gets stored in human readable JSON format. The web-based interface (admin panel) makes it very easy even for beginners to create and manage the blog. \r\n\r\n[**Read More**][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Markdown\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/bloggercms-demo\/post\/introducing-bloggercms.html",
