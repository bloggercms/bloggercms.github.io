		"body": "> ## Prerequisite ##\r\n> \r\n> You can run BloggerCMS on your web host or on your local PC; in both\r\n> cases you can create your blog and upload it where you want. In either\r\n> case we expect you have **PHP available and also mod_rewrite module\r\n> activated**. If you want to run BloggerCMS on your local computer, you\r\n> can go for [XAMPP][1].\r\n\r\nIn this guide, we will start from scratch by downloading and installing BloggerCMS and adding posts and pages and have a blog up and running. The whole process is no longer than 10 minutes but reading and then following takes bit of time of course.\r\n\r\n## Downloading BloggerCMS ##\r\n\r\nHead over to [BloggerCMS Github Repository][2] and download BloggerCMS either by [clonning it's repository][3] or [direct zip download][4] option.\r\n\r\n## Installing BloggerCMS ##\r\n\r\nYou can either install BloggerCMS on your local PC or on your web hosting provider. In either case, you can generate a blog. In this guide though, we explain how to install it on local PC and be able to generate a blog and upload it where we want.\r\n\r\nWe assume, you have already downloaded BloggerCMS and have installed XAMPP or similar solution. Please follow these steps to install it:\r\n\r\n - Move the BloggerCMS folder to your web root folder usually named **www** or **htdocs**.\r\n - Visit the BloggerCMS url on localhost. It's url will be like **http:\/\/localhost\/BloggerCMS** assuming folder name is **BloggerCMS**. You should see BloggerCMS dashboard page like shown below:\r\n\r\n![Dashboard][5]\r\n\r\n## Updating Settings ##\r\n\r\nWe now need to update required **Blog URL** field in settings page. Go to settings page by clicking on its link:\r\n\r\n![enter image description here][6]\r\n\r\nAnd then specify Blog URL field to be **http:\/\/localhost\/BloggerCMS\/public\/**.\r\n\r\n> **Note**: This is just an example, in real world case, for **Blog URL**\r\n> field, you would specify actual your of your blog where you upload it\r\n> something like **http:\/\/mydomain.com\/blog**. For this very blog, it is\r\n> specified like **https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io** since our blog is\r\n> hosted on https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io.\r\n\r\n![enter image description here][7]\r\n\r\nYou should also update other blog settings **Blog Title**, **Blog Tagline** and **Author Name** and finally click on the **Update** button on the bottom. You can also **Follow Settings** and **Custom Values** (custom values can be embedded in layout) on the settings page.\r\n\r\n## Generating Static Blog ##\r\n\r\nTo generate your fully functional static blog, click on the **Generate Blog** on the top right:\r\n\r\n![enter image description here][8]\r\n\r\nYou will see success message like this:\r\n\r\n![enter image description here][9]\r\n\r\nCheck out your **BloggerCMS\/public** folder which was empty before should now contain your blog files generated:\r\n\r\n![enter image description here][10]\r\n\r\nTo see the blog, visit **http:\/\/localhost\/BloggerCMS\/public** in your browser and you should see your blog:\r\n\r\n![enter image description here][11]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/XAMPP\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/github.com\/sarfraznawaz2005\/BloggerCMS\r\n  [3]: http:\/\/git-scm.com\/book\/en\/v2\/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository#Cloning-an-Existing-Repository\r\n  [4]: https:\/\/github.com\/sarfraznawaz2005\/BloggerCMS\/archive\/master.zip\r\n  [5]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284143735523dfa5c5e4f.png\r\n  [6]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284145465523e052c6d86.gif\r\n  [7]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284178245523ed20d5205.gif\r\n  [8]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284173025523eb16e9ab9.gif\r\n  [9]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284171195523ea5f25fd0.gif\r\n  [10]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284175465523ec0a4da50.gif\r\n  [11]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284182715523eedf19057.png",

		"body": "BloggerCMS is a CMS made in PHP that helps you create truly static blogs via provided admin panel interface; you don't need to create blog posts manually in text files or knowing [Markdown][1] syntax unlike other static site generators which is time-consuming. The created blogs become fully potable without any dependencies such as database or any other complicated setups. All data of the blog gets stored in human readable JSON format. The web-based interface (admin panel) makes it very easy even for beginners to create and manage the blog. \r\n\r\n[**Read More**][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Markdown\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/post\/introducing-bloggercms.html",
