The created blogs become fully potable without any dependencies such as database or any other complicated setups. All data of the blog gets stored in human readable JSON format. The web-based interface (admin panel) makes it very easy even for beginners to create and manage the blog. \r\n\r\nTo deploy your blog, all you need is upload the static blog generated by BloggerCMS to your web host and see it in action. You don't need any server-side language support or database on your hosting provider because everything generated by BloggerCMS is pure HTML. You can also host your blog on [Github][2] (this blog demo runs on github), [Dropbox][3] or any other service you like. The good thing is that you can easily backup your blog too because it's just a folder containing your blog. \r\n\r\nBloggerCMS comes with fully responsive blog template based on famous [Twitter Bootstrap][4] with quite few themes to choose from. You can also create your own blog layouts, all you need to know is HTML and basics of [Mustache][5] template engine.\r\n\r\n## Features ##\r\n\r\n - **Graphical User Interface** - manage your site via a browser\r\n - **File-based** - no database required\r\n - **Truly Static** - no server-side languages needed\r\n - **Portability** - copy, move, backup or version control your site easily\r\n - **Integrated Markdown Editor** - no need to know Markdown\r\n - **Built-in Images Manager**\r\n - **Disqus Commenting System**\r\n - **Search Posts Feature**\r\n - **Responsive Layout** - get started easily with the included responsive layout\r\n - **RSS Support**\r\n - **Sitemap Support**\r\n - **Code Highlight Support**\r\n - **Tags Cloud Support**\r\n - **Social Follow Section**\r\n - **Categories Section**\r\n - **Archives Section**\r\n \r\n## Screenshots ##\r\n\r\nAlthough, you can create your own custom layouts but here are screenshots for **default** layout with different themes:\r\n\r\n![Default Theme][6]\r\n\r\n![Darkly Theme][7]\r\n\r\n![Journal Theme][8]\r\n\r\n![Slate Theme][9]\r\n\r\n![Yeti Theme][10]\r\n\r\n![Superhere Theme][11]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n...and here are some of the screenshots for administration interface:\r\n\r\n![Dashboard][12]\r\n\r\n![Add Post][13]\r\n\r\n![View Posts][14]\r\n\r\n![Categories][15]\r\n\r\n![Tags][18]\r\n\r\n![Images Manager][16]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting Started ##\r\n\r\n[Read Getting Started Guide][17]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Markdown\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\r\n  [3]: http:\/\/www.dropboxwiki.com\/tips-and-tricks\/host-websites-with-dropbox\r\n  [4]: http:\/\/getbootstrap.com\/\r\n  [5]: https:\/\/mustache.github.io\/\r\n  [6]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049925523bb002de49.png\r\n  [7]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049865523bafaea4be.png\r\n  [8]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049955523bb0381ec8.png\r\n  [9]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049985523bb06b28d7.png\r\n  [10]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284050065523bb0e769a3.png\r\n  [11]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284050035523bb0b5b371.png\r\n  [12]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049565523badca2571.png\r\n  [13]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049305523bac2f0d6c.png\r\n  [14]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049675523bae7ef288.png\r\n  [15]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049445523bad0ef14d.png\r\n  [16]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049615523bae133905.png\r\n  [17]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/page\/get-started.html\r\n  [18]: https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/images\/14284049645523bae48759c.png",
